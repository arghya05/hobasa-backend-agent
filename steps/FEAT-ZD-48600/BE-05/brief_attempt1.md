# Step BE-05: Coding (attempt 1) for FEAT-ZD-48600

- Workbook trigger: Previous outcome
- Workbook action: Coding for the implementation required for changes in the components/layers with proper comments and required documentation
- Workbook outcome: Updated repo with the new implemented code changes
- Owner of this step: Developer
- Gate (who approves this output): no gate: automated checks, the independent judge and sampled human evaluation

## Inputs (GitHub checkout; read them with Read, or context_get for a receipt)
- task.components (Components, layers, sources or pipelines to change): `hobasa-backend-agent/inputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/BE-05/task.components.md` (from hobasa-backend-agent/outputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/task.components.md at commit f956a35)
- feat.design (HLD, LLD and contracts): `hobasa-backend-agent/inputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/BE-05/feat.design.md` (from hobasa-design-agent/outputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/feat.design.md at commit 722a98f)
- feat.stories (Epics, stories and tasks with numbered AC, frame links, assumptions and open items (latest revision)): `hobasa-backend-agent/inputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/BE-05/feat.stories.md` (from hobasa-requirement-agent/outputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/feat.stories.md at commit 0590ea4)
- org.engineering_stack (Repositories, languages, versions and exact commands): `hobasa-backend-agent/inputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/BE-05/org.engineering_stack.md` (from hobasa-agentic-sdlc/org/org.engineering_stack.md at commit 3b03f15)
- org.lessons (Approved lessons and eval cases): `hobasa-backend-agent/inputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/BE-05/org.lessons.md` (from hobasa-agentic-sdlc/org/org.lessons.md at commit 3b03f15)
- task.secrets_scope (Secrets granted for the task's environments (names only)): restricted, passed by reference only

## Outputs (write each file in full; the spine commits and pushes after evaluation and approval)
- task.code (Code changes on the working branch): write `hobasa-backend-agent/outputs/FEAT-ZD-48600/task.code.md`

## Code
Work in repository `ap-aging-sample` (Python 3.9 (standard library)). You may change only: src/ap_aging/, docs/, README.md. Shell commands allowed in this step: `/usr/bin/python3 ci.py`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`. Run the CI yourself with `/usr/bin/python3 ci.py` from the repository root (or delegate to the ci-runner subagent) until it passes. Do not commit or push; the spine does. Document what you change: update the repository's README.md and docs/ (module overview, new functions with signatures, inputs, outputs and examples).

## How to work
Decide the best way to do this step from the inputs and the workbook action, plan it (TodoWrite for multi-part work), then do it. Helper subagents you can delegate to: explorer, verifier, ci-runner (use the verifier before you finish when the output makes many factual statements). Use the shared memory (memory_search) for decisions and lessons. Connectors approved for you: api:osv (Known vulnerabilities for a dependency version (POST /v1/query with {"package":{"name":...,"ecosystem":"PyPI|npm"},"version":...})), api:pypi (Python package metadata: latest version, licence, release dates (GET /pypi/<package>/json)). Use one only when your inputs do not hold what you need; request a missing one with capability_request. You may also read any other file in the GitHub checkouts your step needs (for example other requirements when grouping, or code); cite it as file:<repository>/<path>.

Finish with the structured result: approach, tools_used, claims (each citing an input item name, a tool view, api:<name>, mcp:<server>, file:<repository>/<path> for any other GitHub file you read, record:intake, record:owner_answer, record:memory or record:brief for this brief; a claim drawing on several sources lists them separated by ';'; every number must appear in what you cite), open questions (BLOCKING: only when you cannot finish), summary.
